Alta Via 1 - 8 days hike through Dolomites region in north of Italy.

## Day 0 - Munich -> Bolzano

The jorney starts by taking a FlixBus from Munich ZOB until Bolzano.
It is a very chill and uncomplicated trip of about 4,5 hours.

Getting in Bolzano, and still feeling in Germany/Austria, I had lunch and rested a bit waiting for Dani.

She was in London, took a flight to Milan and finally a FlixBus to Bolzano.

After she arrived we had dinner and went to the hotel to rest. 

The next day would be very heavy, since we would need to move to the starting point of the hike.

## Day 1 - Lago de Braies -> Rifugio Fodara

The first day started quite early, since we still had to move to the Lago de Braies (Pragser Wildsee).

The jorneys starts with a train from Bolzano to Fortezza, followed to a train to Villabasa.

Getting in Villabasse, we still had to take a bus to the lake. As I reminder, you need to [book](https://www.prags.bz/en/offer/detail/shuttle-pragser-wildsee-lake_21?rootdocument=307&tp=prags) the tickets in advance before taking the bus.

We could get in the lake around 10am and after some photos we finally started the hike


The first day started with a steep accent with nice views in the first part of the way.


Some parts with ropes to help the way throgh the rocks

We stopped for lunch and a drink in Rifugio Biella, the first one in alta via 1

Shortly afte, we continued our way to the ending point of the day

Rifugio Fodara

## Day 2 - Rifugio Fodara -> Lago Lagazuoi

The second started with a nice way through a foggy forest

The first part of the day was going down in a very steep path


After some time, we got in the Rifugio PederÃº. We didn't took a break here since it was still very early.


Moving up to the montains again, with very nice views along the way


Our first break was in the Fanes Restaurant, but since it was before 12h, the place was not open yet.

We just stopped for while and had some snacks.

The next stop was in the Rifugio Fanes, where we could have a proper lunch

After a while, we continued our jorney to Lago Lagazuoi

Right before reaching the lake, we had to cross the Lagazuoi Lake Saddle

It was a steep way up between the two sides of the montain 

After we reached the top, we got a nice view of the lake (and the way down)

It was a very steep way down, which caused a bit of pain in the knees. Luckily it was not so long.


This was the final destination of the day


## Day 3 - Lago Lagazuoi -> Rifugio 5 Torri

After waking up and having a small breakfast, we packed our stuff and got ready for another day

The day starts with a steep way up to the Rif Lagazuoi

Getting in the Rifugio, we stopped for a proper breadfast and also to buy some water for the long day ahead

This was the highest point of all the hike, but at the same time the place was very crawded due the cable car that leads to this point.

We could also see the tunnels that were built on the montain and used in war times 


We went through beatifull landscapes until we reach the lowest point, the road the goes between the montains

At this point, we had to cross the road and go up again

After a few hours walking in the woods, we finally got in the Rifugio 5 Torri

It was a very nice place to stay. We had dinner and soon after we hit the bed

## Day 4 - Rifugio 5 Torri -> Rifugio Staulanza

It was raining during the night, but gladly it stopped in the morning

The weather was very cloudy, and the forecast was saying that it might rain at any moment

The first part of the day was going very nicely, with nice views in the middle of the woods

Until it finely stated to rain, which quictly developed to a hale storm


No photos until we got in the Refugio Crota da Lago, where we could have a nice and warm lunch


After lunch the weather was looking a bit better, but not for long


After a heavy rain, in the afternoon it finally stopped raining

The we could finally get into the next rifugio

## Day 5 - Rifugio Stalanza -> Rifugio Vazzoler

The day stated with some sun, opportunity to dry the clothes

The weather was still very cloudy, but not as the day before


After a very short rain, we could stop in refugio Coldai for lunch

We shared the table with a nice family we met in the day before

The rest of the day would be hiking together with them

After some time, they took the way to a different rifugio

Then we move forward to our final destination

Gladly we arrived before the rain

## Day 6 - Rifugio Vazzoler -> Rifugio Passo Duran

This was the shortest day of the hike


First we went through the woods on the sides of some montains


Then we moved to some exposed areas, which required a lot of attention

After a while we stopped for lunch in refugio Carestiato

The final destination was very close already

Getting there we had to wait for the accomodation to be ready

So we had some beer and snacks

## Day 7 - Rifugio Passo Duran -> Rifugio Pian de Fontana

This would be the longest day of the hike

Also with the highest elevation

We tried to start the journey as soon as possible

We went through diffent landscapes this day

Luckily, we weather was very nice

We stopped for lunch in the Rifugio Pramperet


And then we start the climbing of the day




We left Rio Preto on friday around 5pm.

The trip would last about three hours, but an additional one was just waiting for the ferry to get into Delfinopolis.

We got there about 11pm and went directly to the dinner, which was amazing after a long trip.

In the night we discussed the itinerary for the next day with Zelito (owner of the campsite).

He helped us a lot and even draw a map of his own mind.

In the morning, we had a good breakfast at the camping site before a long day to come.

We left the camping site about 9am, which was pretty late, due to the intense sun that day.

This is the tail of the first day, there were some changes to the original plan, but everything went fine.

More information about this change you can listen in the podcast.

We passed through the Claro camping and went to Paraiso complex.

This is where we had our first break and stopped for lunch.

After a while we continued our journey, there was a lot to walk yet.

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1DQJBPMYC679bfQAWve4sKYnwskgl_OHa)

The trail along the Paraiso complex was well demarcated and easy to follow.

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1x0JcP35nelyGN2WsBLdtyIXh5Ouc0mOj)

It was a very hot day and we needed to cool down in the waterfalls in the path.

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1DZngxuChM5Sd9oA5CfStpQRIsnGZs034)

We kept climbing even higher.

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1Ico-AWo2gFscq1Y228mYhl_rRn5FL5ae)

I think that this was the hardest moment of the hiking. The backpack was also very heavy (and not well packed)

<iframe src="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1u7KcqbBU_kusJCYOakCjv3XKR_dXY1RG/preview" class="is-fullwidth" height="480"></iframe>

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1u1TLLO_4VQpxnReHgTc77VoRHokpD2dF)

At this point, we went to the last waterfall of the complex: Cachoeira do Triangulo

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=11t89nMnmvIh-e0d-0TbmnbxYZ9hClsSa)

The name is self-explanatory.

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1QjMQaxS0KgYMDtFSWMSxXq-G3UhGaHmp)

At this point, the original plan was to keep climbing around the waterfall until the dirt road, and then our wanted camping spot: Seu Lazinho

Unfortunately, we were following an old trail in wikiloc, so a lot had changed in the path, and the grass was very tall at that moment.

This way, we decided to turn back all the way until the main dirt road, outside the Paraiso complex (as you can see in the trail in wikiloc).

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1kBN1GJsvbMYRCEVmzaNliZ3JhuNL7Wkg)

At that moment, we were quite disappointed because we couldn't get to the desired camping spot.
We decided to sleep in the lookout of this dirt road, which was a long walk ahead.

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=16Cm_gSECIHMLc-RWWHqDMmrHiG1MP9Qk)

It was getting dark and we were very tired, gladly we could get a ride from Euler and Rosi.

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1lBUtxYy0yvZev2v_ejue0qYiVP34KHWR)

They helped us a lot, without the ride we would not get there in time to see this amazing sunset.

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1PORIMX8jRZ6sTCTLzySDgyxGDRUYmXzJ)

We set up our tent very quickly and even had some time to drink wine and talk with this amazing couple.


![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1T1QNCwuCY-FWWghP52lUODRP8DSVUEdx)

After a while they had to go away, leaving us alone to enjoy that wonderful view.


![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1eXWQThnDH2VyeIsa7feaaiUy6TAuIYTZ)

We were very tired, so we didn't take long to fall asleep. The heavy winds scared us a bit in the night, but we could get a good night of sleep.

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1M8Hrg43e36UaPa9elpn7WYlxDvWejaml)

In the morning, even before the sunrise we already had our coffee ready.

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=11eTXzyOPlmG0FfZnSM_BSDlUuzCLICr2)

we took some time to enjoy the sunrise, to finally pack our stuff and keep our journey back to the campsite. After all, this was a weekend trekking and we had to go back to our city.

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1dCGPnycva28XDjhgTA_FQ4nKmbwvUW9r)

While we were packing our stuff, a motorcycle shows up next to us. At first we didn't understand why someone would be there so early (and in a regular motorcycle, not a trail one).

After a while we figured out the reason, the biker probably set a place next to the road on fire, as you can on the next picture.

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1L7YplPoWVfALuJxof8ULc1uDBzWJ3-Lp)

It is unbelievable that someone would do such a thing like that. We were very worried to pass on that place because of the fire, but we hurried to get to the other side as soon as possible. After all, it was the only way available for us.

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1O_U9y9cJyiEdjhYMU2BG0cB_Q4WdaJmV)

On the way back to the Claro complex, we tried to alert the authorities about such event, but we failed due the week mobile signal. At the same time, we alerted everyone that passed by us on the road.

It was only when we got to the Claro complex that we could alert the gate keeper, and he quickly warned the responsible authorities.

Also at the Claro complex we had lunch and rested a bit in the waterfalls.

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=157reUqESvlOJ8tBgr7--KVS_edjqdBX5)

And then we kept our hiking to the camping site. That was a very hot day and the sun was burning like hell!

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1eYYaiV6jquhc7oSMPLCDdH0fg6L9dT4L)

We got to the campsite, took a shower and started to get ready to go back home.

Lucky we had some time to talk to Zelito. He even gave us a whole banana bunch.

After a long drive we got home, very grateful for that amazing trekking (despite the wildfire) and already planning for our next trekking.

----------

Thanks to Dani, Zelito, Euler and Rosi for this wonderful adventure.
