The trip would last for about 3 hour, but a additional one was waiting for the ferry to get into Delfinopolis

We got there about 11pm and went direct to the dinner, which was amazing after a long trip

In the night we discussed the itinerary for the next day with Zelito (owner of the campsite)

He help us a lot and even draw a map of his own mind

We leave the camping site about 9am, which was pretty late, due to the intense sun that day

We passthru Claro camping and went to Paraiso complex.

This is where we had our first break and stoped for lunch

After a while we continued our journey, there ware a lot to walk yet

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1DQJBPMYC679bfQAWve4sKYnwskgl_OHa)

The trail along the Paraiso complex was well demarked and easy to follow

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1x0JcP35nelyGN2WsBLdtyIXh5Ouc0mOj)

It was a very hot day and we needed to cool down in the waterfalls in the path

We keep climbing even higher

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1u1TLLO_4VQpxnReHgTc77VoRHokpD2dF)

At this point, we went to the last waterfall of the complex: Cachoeira do Triangulo

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=11t89nMnmvIh-e0d-0TbmnbxYZ9hClsSa)

The name is Self explanatory

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1QjMQaxS0KgYMDtFSWMSxXq-G3UhGaHmp)

At this point, the original plan was to keep climbing around the waterfall until the dirt road, and then our wanted camping spot: Seu Lazinho
Unfortunetly, we were following an old trail in wikiloc, so a lot changed in the path, and the grass was very tall at that moment.
This way, we decided to turn back all the way until the main dirt road, outside the Paraiso complex.

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1kBN1GJsvbMYRCEVmzaNliZ3JhuNL7Wkg)

At that moment, we were quite disaponted because we couldn't get to the desired camping spot.
We decided to sleep in the lookout of this dirt road, which was a long walk ahead.

It was getting dark and we were very tired, gladly we could get a ride from Euler and Rosi.

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1lBUtxYy0yvZev2v_ejue0qYiVP34KHWR)

They help us a lot, without the ride we would not get there in time to see this amazing sunset

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1PORIMX8jRZ6sTCTLzySDgyxGDRUYmXzJ)

we set up out tend very quickly and even had some time to drink some wine and talk with this amazing couple


![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1T1QNCwuCY-FWWghP52lUODRP8DSVUEdx)

after a while they had to go away, leaving us alone to enjoy that wonderfull view


![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1eXWQThnDH2VyeIsa7feaaiUy6TAuIYTZ)

We didn't take long to fall asleep cause we were very tired, but the heavy winds scare us a bit in the night.
At the morning, even before the sunrise we already had our coffee ready

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=11eTXzyOPlmG0FfZnSM_BSDlUuzCLICr2)

we took some time to enjoy the sunrise, to finally pack our stuff and keep our jorney back to the campsite, after all, this was a weekend trekking and we had to go back to our city.

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1dCGPnycva28XDjhgTA_FQ4nKmbwvUW9r)

While we were packing our stuff, a motoclycle shows up next to us. At first we didn't understand why someone would be there so early (and in a regular motocycle, not a trail one).
After a while we figured out the reason, the biker probaly set a place next to the road on fire, as you can on the next picture.

![](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=1L7YplPoWVfALuJxof8ULc1uDBzWJ3-Lp)

It is unbelieveble that someone would do a thing like that. We were very worried to pass on that place because of the fire, but we hurry to get to the other side as soon as possible, after all, it was the only way available for us.
On the way back to the Claro complex, we tried to alert the authorites about such event but we failed due the week mobile signal. At the same time we alerted everyone the pass by us on the road.

It was only when we got to the Claro complex that we could alert the gate keeper, and he quickly warned the responsible authorities.

also at the claro complex we had lunch and rested a bit in the waterfalls

and then we keep our hikking to the camping site. That was a very hot day and the sun was burning like hell!

we got to the campsite took a shower and start to get ready to go back home.
Lucky we had some time to talk to Zelito and he even gave us a whole banana bunch.
After a long drive we got home, very gratefull for that amazing trekking (despite the wildfire) and already planning for our next trekking.

----------

Thanks to Dani, Zelito, Euler and Rosi for this wonderfull adventure.
