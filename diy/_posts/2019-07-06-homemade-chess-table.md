Some day a friend of mine comes with an idea of making his own chess table.
In the same moment I knew I had to make my own too.




## Ingredients

  - 400g all-purpose flour
  - 250ml warm milk
  - 30g fresh yeast
  - 1/2 teaspoon sugar
  - 1 teaspoon salt
  - 1 egg
  - 2 tablespoons olive oil
  - rock salt and thyme to taste

## Topping

  - shredded mozzarella cheese
  - olive oil (from the dried tomato)
  - rock salt
  - thyme

## Instructions

  - Combine the flour, sugar, yeast and the warm milk. Knead until smooth
  - Add egg and salt. Knead until dough is smooth and elastic (add more flour if needed)
  - Let it rest for 20 minutes. Preheat the oven to 350ºF (~ 180ºC)
  - Put the dough in a flat baking sheet. Spread the dough like a pizza and poke some dimples (you can use your fingers)
  - Bake for about 15 minutes
  - Top with cheese, dried tomatos, thyme, rock salt and olive oil
  - Bake for more 15 minutes
