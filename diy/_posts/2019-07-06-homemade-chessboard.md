Some day a friend of mine comes with an idea of making his own chessboard.
In the same moment I knew I had to make my own too.

## The approch

I don't have the right tools to work with wood yet. That way, cutting the wood into little squares by hand would probally lead to a poor job.
So, I got an ideia to use a MDF board of the right size and use table edge tape cutted into squares to make the chess positions.

  - No wood cutting necessary

Thanks to Rafael Medeiros for the idea and for lending me a paper guillotine to cut the table edge squares.
