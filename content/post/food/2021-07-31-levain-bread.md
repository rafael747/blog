The whole process can take a while, but once you have the levain you will become addicted to this recipe.

# Making the levain

## Ingredients

  - all-purpose flour
  - water
  - some fermented liquid: yogurt, fruit juice, etc.. (optional)

## Instructions

  - Combine the flour, water, and if you wish to accelerate the process, some fermented liquid. The proportions may vary a lot, but a safe rule of thumb is 1 to 1 (flour and water). I used yogurt to accelerate the process, just a spoon is enough.
  - Mix it very well and leave it a non sealed container (outside the fridge)
  - On the next day, discart half of the mixture and add a bit of flour and water (1 - 1 - 1) (refresh process)
  - Repeat the process until you get a mixture that doubles in size in between the refresh periods   
  - Now you can store your levain in the fridge
  - Every week you can refresh the mixture (then leave outside the fridge until doubled in size, then store in fridge again)

# Making the bread

## Ingredients

  - 400g all-purpose flour (for the bread)
  - 240g water (for the bread)
  - 80g levain
  - 20g flour (to activate the levain)
  - 20g water (to activate the levain)
  - 10g salt
  - 10g sugar
  - 10g olive oil 

## Instructions

  - Combine the flour (400g) and the water (240g), mix it well and cover it to maintain the humidity.
  - Combine the levain (80g), flour (20g) and the water (20g).
  - Wait until the levain is fully activated (doubled in size).
  - Mix the flour-water mixture, the activated levain, sugar and the olive oil. After mixing, join the salt.
  - Let it rest for 30 minutes.
  - Fold the dough from the bottom up about 5 times and then let it rest for 30 minutes.
  - Repeat this process 4 times.
  - Give it a desired shape in a banneton (I used an improvised one). Let it rest for 24h in the fridge.
  - Decorate the bread with a very sharp knife or with a custom made bread scoring tool (see below) 
  - Place the dough in a closed pan (you can place a baking paper in the bottom).
  - Let it rest for more 8h hours, this time outside the fridge.
  - Bake for about 25 minutes with the pan closed (280ºC)
  - Remove the lid from the pan and let it bake for more 25 minutes (220ºC)
