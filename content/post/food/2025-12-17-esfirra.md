## Ingredients for the dough

  - 1 cup oil
  - 1 cup milk
  - 1 cup water 
  - 1/2 spoon dry yeast
  - 1/2 spoon salt
  - 1/2 spoon sugar
  - enough flour

## Ingredients for the filling 

  - Minced meat (mettwurst for extra juicyness)
  - Fine chopped tomatoes
  - Fine chopped onions
  - Crumbled blue cheese for extra taste
  - Seasoning (salt, pepper, spices)
  - Squeezed lime right before filling the dough


## Instructions

  - Combine oil, milk and water. Make it warm to accelerate the rising process.
  - Add the dry yeast, salt, sugar and mix it well.
  - Add enough flour until the dough is not sticking too much.
  - Let it rest for a 15 minutes

  - Mix the dough again.
  - Make small balls and place them in a place so they don't stick to each other when rising. Add a bit of oil in the hands, so they will not stick to your hand.
  - Let them rest for another 15 minutes

  - Make them flat in your hand, add the filling and fold them in a triangular shape.
  - Place them in a non sticking baking tray (or add a bit of oil to a regular tray).
  - Let them rest for another 15 minutes and then bake until they start to turn golden.
