This was the starting point for us, [Rorschach Hafen](https://goo.gl/maps/TqeqRUHehxLQCrzG6)

Then we were ready to start the hike

## Rorschach -> St. Gallen (18.5km)

We opt for a shorter hike in the first day since it is a long way to get into the start point. We started our hike around 1pm.

The weather was cloudy and a bit cold but still very nice for hiking

Arriving in St. Gallen.

Destination for today, [Pilgerherberge Sankt Gallen](https://www.pilgerherberge-sg.ch/). 

We were received with warm tea and after a nice talk we went out to buy something for dinner. Even though it was a holiday, we could find some open stores to buy the easiest food to prepare: pasta

We had a nice kitchen available for us to prepare dinner and breakfast.

Our first stop of the day. Later we got to know that everyone that stayed in the same accomodation in the day before actually stopped in this place too.

Here we could meet Fritz and Selena again. We stayed in the same accomodation in the day before, but this time we could spend some time together and talk more. They are doing the full way from Munich until Santiago de Compostela, around 4 months hiking. The were super nice and it was a pleasure to hear their story.

We stopped for a while and after a nice talk with our hosts we went to a local restaurant nearby. 

Back to our accomodation. The place was absolutely beatiful and well decorated.
