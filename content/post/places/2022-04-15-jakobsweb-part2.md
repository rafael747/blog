It's been only a few weeks since I've completed the [first half of the way](/hiking/2022-03-24-jakobsweb-part1/), and it was amazing!
This way, I was really looking forward to do the second half of the Münchner Jakobsweg as soon as possible.

We have 2 days holiday for Easter in Germany, so it was the perfect oportunity to complete the jorney.

## ~~Lechbruck~~ Füssen -> Marktoberdorf (12km)

Since it was the Good Friday holiday, it would be a bit complicated to go to Lechbruck via public transportation. So I took a train to Füssen, becauce on the way back it would be very easy to go to Marktoberdorf.

This way I actually skipped the first day of the hike.

It would be a 10km hike from Füssal to Neuschwainstein Castle. Then I would take a bus back to the city

It was a rainny week, so I was a bit worried about the weather, but luckly it didn't rained at all

A nice view of the Alpsee

And from Neuschwainstein Castle

At this point I was almost ready to take the bus back to Füssen and then the train to Marktoberdorf.

However, I met a very nice girl with a spare ticket to visit the castle. We went for the tour, then we stopped for lunch. It was very nice, we could talk a lot.

She even gave me a ride back to Füssen, then I took the train to Marktoberdorf to finally start the Jorney again.

## Marktoberdorf -> Kempten (33km)

![](/cdn/2022-04-15-jakobsweb-part2/IMG_20220415_174151.jpg)

This day I stayed at [Pilgerquartier - Marktoberdorf](https://pq-mod.de/pq-mod-de-cool-home/das-pq/das-haus/)

![](/cdn/2022-04-15-jakobsweb-part2/IMG_20220415_191541.jpg)

It was a nice place with a good Pilgrim atmosphere

Perfect place for a break

![](/cdn/2022-04-15-jakobsweb-part2/IMG_20220416_124733.jpg)

At this time I was still a bit worried about the weather, but as long it was not ranning, the cloudy weather was great

![](/cdn/2022-04-15-jakobsweb-part2/IMG_20220416_190241.jpg)

This was the destination of the day: [Pfarrei St. Anton - Kempten](https://www.st-anton-ke.de/index.php)

![](/cdn/2022-04-15-jakobsweb-part2/IMG_20220416_154945.jpg)

And this was my room. It was my first time staying overnight in a church, and the experience was very interesting. I just would like to say thanks for the hospitality.

## Kempten -> Weitnau (28km)

![](/cdn/2022-04-15-jakobsweb-part2/IMG_20220417_085525.jpg)

I started the hiking early in the morning and from this point the weather was just getting better

Perfect place for a break

Stopping for a beer in [Widdum - Weitnau](https://goo.gl/maps/YRpswxm4uUq2vtct6)

![](/cdn/2022-04-15-jakobsweb-part2/IMG_20220418_075606.jpg)

And this was the destination of the day: [Gasthof Krone](https://g.page/gasthof-krone-weitnau?share)

In a room with a nice view

## Weitnau -> Scheidegg (38km)

![](/cdn/2022-04-15-jakobsweb-part2/IMG_20220418_074916.jpg)

After the breakfast I was about to start the longest day of Münchener Jakobsweb

![](/cdn/2022-04-15-jakobsweb-part2/IMG_20220418_094019.jpg)

The weather was very nice

![](/cdn/2022-04-15-jakobsweb-part2/IMG_20220418_105613.jpg)

Making new friends along the way

![](/cdn/2022-04-15-jakobsweb-part2/IMG_20220418_113733.jpg)

All kind of friends

![](/cdn/2022-04-15-jakobsweb-part2/IMG_20220419_082530.jpg)

And after a long day this was the destination of the day: [Pilgerzentrum Scheidegg](https://pilgerzentrum-scheidegg.de/pilgerherberge/)

I was so done for the day that I didn't remembered to take more pictures of the place, but it was very nice.

## Scheidegg -> Bregenz (17km)

![](/cdn/2022-04-15-jakobsweb-part2/IMG_20220419_082531.jpg)

The original plan was to go to Lindau directly, but after some talk in the pilgerzentrum, I was convinced that the way to Bregenz would be even more beautiful

![](/cdn/2022-04-15-jakobsweb-part2/IMG_20220419_084943.jpg)

This way goes through [Möggers Ulrichsbrunnen - Austria](https://austria-forum.org/af/Kunst_und_Kultur/B%C3%BCcher/Heilige_Quellen/Vorarlberg/M%C3%B6ggers_Ulrichsbrunnen), a nice chapel with its famous medicinal water

![](/cdn/2022-04-15-jakobsweb-part2/IMG_20220419_093425.jpg)

The way goes through the woods in the border between Germany and Austria 

![](/cdn/2022-04-15-jakobsweb-part2/IMG_20220419_094457.jpg)

With a nice view to the montains

![](/cdn/2022-04-15-jakobsweb-part2/IMG_20220419_111530.jpg)

It would be possible to go hiking all the way to Bregenz.
However, I took the cable car in [Pfänder](https://www.pfaenderbahn.at/en/pfaenderbahn)

![](/cdn/2022-04-15-jakobsweb-part2/IMG_20220419_111927.jpg)

It cost 8,20 euro and the trip takes about 6 minutes. The view to the lake and the montains is amazing.

![](/cdn/2022-04-15-jakobsweb-part2/IMG_20220419_150535.jpg)

Once in Bregenz I put the last stamp on the pilgrim credential and went for lunch

![](/cdn/2022-04-15-jakobsweb-part2/IMG_20220419_153208.jpg)

After a while enjoying the city, I took a boat to Lindau to finally end the journey.

On the train back to Munich I was so gratefull for everything I have experienced. I'm already looking forward the next step in the Jakobsweb.
