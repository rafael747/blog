I am changing the blog's domain name to teffa.dev

<!--more-->

Time have come, and the domain teffa.online is going to expire.
I've found that it is cheaper (and actually looks better) to swap to a google's .dev domain.

Since I am not an actual developer, I also move the about page to teffa.dev/ops which describes better my job (and looks very cool though)

I will also make a post about using zabbix to monitor domain expiration soon.
