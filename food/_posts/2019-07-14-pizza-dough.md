Ok, it is easier to buy dough when making pizza. Actually, it is much easier to just order a pizza. However, where would the fun be?

## Ingredients

  - 900g all-purpose flour
  - 500ml warm water
  - 15g salt
  - 20g yeast (I usually use dry yeast for this recipe)

## Instructions

  - Combine the flour, yeast and the warm water. Knead until smooth
  - Add salt. Knead until dough is smooth and elastic (add more flour if needed)
  - Let it rest for about 45m ~ 60m
  - Spread dough in a oil greased pizza sheet
  - Add toppings
  - Bake for about 30 minutes in a preheated oven (430ºF ~ 220ºC)
